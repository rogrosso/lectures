# Geometric Modeling
The geometric modeling course handles the following topics:

1. Polynomial Curves
2. Bézier Curves
3. B-Spline Curves
4. Rational Curves
5. Geometric Continuity
6. Tensor Product Surfaces
7. Subdivision Surfaces

These lectures are about different aspects of modeling three-dimensional curves and surfaces. Typical application areas are 
computer-aided design (CAD), reconstruction of surfaces from sensor data (reverse engineering), and construction of smooth 
interpolants. The lecture covers the following topics:

                <li>Bézier curves</li>
                <li>B-splines curves</li>
                <li>Rational Bézier and B-Spline curves</li>
                <li>Tensor product surfaces</li>
                <li>Subdivision Surfaces</li>

Each folder contains the implementations for the different algorithms discussed in the course. For one of the implemented 
algorithms, there is an *html* and a *JavaScript* that implements the technique. In order to run the code, a *live-server* is 
required, and I use Visual Studio Code and the *live-server* plugin.
