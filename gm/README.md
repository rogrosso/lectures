# Geometric Modeling
The geometric modeling course handles the following topics:

1. Polynomial Curves
2. BÃ©zier Curves
3. B-Spline Curves
4. Rational Curves
5. Geometric Continuity
6. Tensor Product Surfaces
7. Subdivision Surfaces

Each folder contain the implementations for the different algorithms discussed in the course. For one
of the implemented algorithms there is a *html* and a *JavaScript* which implement the technique. In 
order to run the code, a *live-server*. I personally use Visual Studio Code and start the web application
with the live-serve plugin.
