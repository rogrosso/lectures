# lectures
This repository include interactive web applications (HTML and Javascript) to demonstrate the methods discussed 
in the lectures I am holding at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t (FAU). I will start with one of the lectures, geometric modeling, other will follow in the next commits. 

There are a lot of duplicated code. I hope this will become better with future commits. The web applications are
interactive. For Visualization I am using d3 for 2D graphics and three.js for visualizing surfaces. Therefore, feel confident and use the mouse and menus to interact with the visualization.
