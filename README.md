# lectures
This repository include interactive web applications (HTML and Javascript) to demonstrate the methods discussed 
in the lectures I am holding at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t (FAU). I will start with one of the lectures 
in the course *geometric modeling*. Lectures for other courses will follow in future commits. 

There are a lot of duplicated code. I hope this will become better with future commits, as far I have time to 
redesign the code. The web applications are interactive. I am using *D3* for 2D graphics and *three.js* for surfaces. Therefore, feel free to use the mouse and menus to interact with the visualization.

## Folder common
This folder contains functions that that are required by some of the implementations in the different topics. One
example are functions for solving simple linear systems or computing the inverse of a matrix.

## Folder gm
This folder contains the web applications implemented for the lectures corresponding to the course 
in *geometric modeling*.

## Remark
I have been having problems with the CDNs, in particular *unpkg* with *D3*. If a web application does not work, please, just edit the *html* file and comment in other CDN.
