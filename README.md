# lectures
This repository include interactive web applications (HTML and Javascript) to demonstrate the methods discussed in the lectures
I am holding at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t (FAU). I will start with one of the lectures, other will follow in the next
commits. 

There are a lot of duplicated code. I hope this will become better with future commits.
