                This repository contains the HTML and Javascript code implementing algorithms discussed in 
                some of the lectures that I give at the University. They are in the area of geometry processing and 
                information visualization. This way, the code and some background information about the 
                algorithms can be freely accessed not only from inside the University. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to see, what is implemented, you can use this website to navigate through the 
                different topics and algorithms. The code can cloned from the 
                <a href="https://github.com/rogrosso/lectures">GitHub site</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will find a lot of duplicated code. I hope this will become better in the future. The web 
                applications are interactive. I am using <strong>D3</strong> for 2D graphics and <strong>three.js</strong> 
                for surfaces. I strongly recommend to interact with the visualizations by selecting and dragging 
                points or by zooming and rotating the 3D geometry. Some of the applications also include a kind 
                of user interface. The code is at this moment certainly buggy. The code was not implemented for 
                industrial usage.

            <h3>Remark</h3>
            <p>
                It is recommended to start with the file <em>index.html</em> in the root/main folder in order 
                to easily navigate through all the applications implemented for the different lectures. In order 
                to run the code, a <em>live-server</em> is required. I personally use Visual Studio Code and 
                the <em>live-server</em> plugin. I have been having problems with the CDNs, in particular 
                <em>unpkg</em> with D3. If a web application does not work, please, just edit the html file and 
                comment in other CDN.

                The code is organized intro three folders containing the algorithms implemented for three
                lectures. The lectures are the following.
            </p>
            <strong>Folder gm</strong>: <a href="./gm/index.html"><strong>Geometric Modeling</strong></a></h2>
            <p>
            We have implemented algorithm for polynomial curves, BÃ©zier- and B-Spline curves. We have also implemented
            algorithms for tensor product and subdivision surfaces. 
            </p>
            <strong>Folder gp</strong>: <a href="./gp/index.html"><strong>Geometry Processing</strong></a>
            <p>
                we have implemented basic algorithms the geometry processing, such point cloud registration, 
                surface reconstruction, fairing and remeshing, ARAP and mesh parametrization.
            </p>
            <strong>Folder infovis</strong>: <a href="./infovis/index.html"><strong>Information Visualization</strong></a>
            <p>
                We have implemented visualization algorithms for colors, multivariate data, networks analysis and
                visualization, hierarchies, and text.
