            <h1>Betweenness Centrality</h1>
            <p>
                Betweenness centrality measures how often a node is in the shortest path of all other network nodes.
            </p>
            <h3>Remark</h3>
            <p>
                Closeness centrality measures the reachability of a node, which can be interpreted as the importance of a 
                vertex in a network. On the other hand, cut vertices, a vertex whose removal partitions the graph, can play 
                a central and essential role in the network. Based on this observation, researchers in social sciences 
                introduced the concept of betweenness centrality, a widespread measure of centrality these days.
            </p>
            <h3>Assumption</h3>
            <p>
                Each pair of nodes exchange information with an equal probability per unit of time. The information flow 
                follows the shortest path.
            </p>
            <h3>Centrality Measure</h3>
            <p>
                After a period of time large enough, the flow rate at a node is proportional to the number of shortest paths 
                through this node.
            </p>
            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>
                Let \(G=(V,E)\) be a connected undirected graph. The betweenness centrality for a node \(v\) is given by
            </p>
            \[
                c_B(v) = \sum_{s,t \in V(G), s\neq v, t\neq v} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}
            \]
            <p>
                where \(\sigma_{st}\) is the total number of shortest paths from \(t\) to \(s\) and \(\sigma_{st}(v)\) is the 
                number of shortest paths from \(t\) to \(s\) which contain the node \(v\).
            </p>
            <h3>Theorem (Brandes, 2001): time complexity</h3>
            <p>
                Betweenness centrality can be computed in \(\mathcal{O}(nm)\) for unweighted graphs. The time complexity for weighted graphs 
                is \(\mathcal{O}(nm + n^2\log n)\).
            </p>
            <h2>Alogrithm</h2>
            <p>
                The algorithm is based on two main components:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An extension of the BFS algorithm (in case of unweighted graphs) to compute the total number of shortest 
                    paths connecting two nodes
                </li>
                <li>
                    A recursion formula to compute the dependency partial sum, which is required to calculate the betweenness 
                    centrality of a node.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Dependency partial sum
                \[
                    \delta_s(v) = \sum_{w:v\in P(w)} \frac{\sigma_{sv}}{\sigma_{sw}} ( 1 + \delta_s(w))
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                The betweenness centrality of a node is obtained as follows:
                \[
                c_B(v) = \sum_{s \in V, s \neq v} \delta_s(v)
                \]
            </p>
