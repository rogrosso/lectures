# Information Visualization
Information visualization deals with the graphical representation of abstract data without spatial structure. 
Abstract data visualization uses visual metaphors and interaction to extract information from the data. 
Typical application scenarios are analyzing financial transactions or social networks, bioinformatics, 
geography, text analysis, or visualization of software source code. In this lecture, different techniques 
are presented to visualize different data types. In particular, the following topics will be addressed:

1. Colors and Color Models
2. Multivariate Data
3. Networks
4. Hierarchies
5. Text

The implemented algorithms are given below. We strongly recommend dragging control points and interacting with 
the graphics to understand the algorithm's purpose.
