            <h1>Squarified Treemap</h1>
            <p>
                A treemap is a visualization technique based on containment that partitions the space recursively according to 
                the size of the subtrees. It is space-filling, where leaf nodes are clearly visualized. 
            </p>
            <h2>The Squarified Algorithm</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Squarified Treemaps, Mark Bruls, Kees Huizing, and Jarke J. van Wijk, 2000</li>
                <li>It generates rectangles with a nice aspect ratio</li>
                <li>
                    The optimal aspect ratio of a rectangle is achieved for a square; 
                    in this case \(\frac{width}{height}=\frac{height}{width}=1\)
                </li>
                <li>Computation of the optimal partition is NP-hard</li>
                <li> The squarified algorithm is a greedy approach that generates solutions with good quality</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>space is used more efficiently (ratio between perimeter and surface is optimal for a square)</li>
                <li>square items are easier to detect that long and thin rectangles</li>
                <li>comparison of sizes is better</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The Algorithm</h2>
            <p>
                Given a rectangle with height \(h\) and large enough, the squarified algorithm draws \(n\) areas 
                \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) within the rectangle representing the leaves of the tree. These areas should be as 
                square as possible and have the same width. Therefore, it follows:
            </p>
            \[
                \begin{align}
                h_1 \times w &= a_1\\
                ...& \\
                h_n \times w &= a_n
                \end{align}
            \]
            <p>
            where \(w\) is the width of the inserted triangles. Tthe following relations for the height and the width of 
            the inserted rectangles apply:
            \[
                (h_1 + \dots + h_n)\times w = (a_1 + \dots + a_n) = a \quad 
                \implies w = \frac{a}{h}, \quad \text{width} \; h = h_1 + \dots h_n
            \]
            <p>
                The height of an inserted rectangle is given by \(h_i = \frac{a_i}{a} h\). The aspect ratio, height over 
                width, of the \(ith\)-rectangle is:
            </p>
            \[
                \frac{h_i}{w} = \frac{a_i}{w^2} = \frac{a_i h^2}{a^2}
            \]
            <p>
                If the aspect ratio is computed as width over height, one gets \(\frac{a^2}{a_i h^2}\).
            </p>
            <p><strong>Main Loop</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <p>if a node has children nodes, layout the children nodes (siblings) with the squarified method</p>
                <p>recursively process each of the children nodes</p>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Layout of Sibling Nodes</strong></p>
            <p>Note: the algorithm refers to rows, even if the drawing area is split vertically.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Input: array of sibling nodes, row, rectable (drawing area)</li>
                <li>sort the children nodes in descending order</li>
                <li>if the function is called for an empty array of sibling nodes, layout the row</li>
                <li>otherwise</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>get first child node from array</li>
                    <li>if the row is empty, add the child node to the row, and call squarified with the remaining siblings</li>
                    <li>otherwise</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>if aspect ratio becomes not worse by inserting node, add to row and call squarified with remaining sibling nodes</li>
                        <li>otherwise layout the row, call squarified with remaining sibling nodes and an empty row</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>Remarks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The main loop over the children nodes is called recursively. 
                    The function is called with the children nodes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The layout of the sibling nodes is called recursively. 
                    The function is called with the remaining sibling nodes.
                </li>
                <li>The rectangular drawing area is split along the longest side</li>
            </ul>
