# Geometry Processing
This lecture introduces some aspects of discrete geometry processing. The focus is on generating, manipulating, and analyzing 
triangular meshes and surface reconstruction from 3D scanner data. The lecture handles to following topics:

1. Polynomial Meshes
2. Planar Triangulations
3. Registration of Point Clouds
4. Surface Reconstruction from Point Clouds
5. Fairing and Remeshing
6. Mesh Deformation
7. Mesh Parametrization

The implemented algorithms are given below, including code snippets. We strongly 
recommend interacting with the graphics to understand the algorithm and its purpose.
